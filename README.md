# Samex-beta
This is a beta version of the new Samex installer, I recommend using the [HTTPS installer](https://github.com/Dfmaaa/Samex)
This works now, just need to update other applications depending on samexmain.github.io
## additional info
 this installer takes files from a server that runs on the apache web server.

# Samex-beta
This is a beta version of the Samex SSH installer, I recommend using the [HTTPS installer](https://github.com/Dfmaaa/Samex)
I am almsot aure that the SSH installer wouldn't work because I don't think I configured it correctly and I don't always keep my laptop on "ON" mode.
I know that is an inconvenience but I am trying to get one laptop to run all the time, some people tell me it's not good for the battery, so I shut it down when I don't use it.
